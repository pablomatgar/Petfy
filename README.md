[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Petfy is a Full Stack NodeJS web application built at [HackUPC 2018](https://2018.hackupc.com), the first student hackathon in Spain (fourth edition).

The purpose of developing this app was trying to create a system that allows people to find pets around them by location and support pet adoption.

This app was developed by two other developers and myself.

*Due to the short amount of time, we could only complete some basic functionalities.
